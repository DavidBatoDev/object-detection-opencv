# üß† Object Detection using OpenCV and a Pretrained Model

This project demonstrates real-time object detection using OpenCV and a pre-trained **SSD MobileNet v3** model trained on the **COCO dataset**.

## üöÄ How It Works

The project uses the **TensorFlow Object Detection API** along with OpenCV's `dnn` module to perform object detection. Here‚Äôs how the system works:

1. **Model and Config Files**
   - `frozen_inference_graph.pb`: The pre-trained TensorFlow model containing the learned weights.
   - `ssd_mobilenet_v3_large_coco_2020_01_14.pbtxt`: Configuration file that defines the model architecture for OpenCV.
   - `coco.names`: A text file that lists all 80 class names from the COCO dataset used for labeling detections.

2. **Preprocessing Input**
   - Input frames are converted into blobs using `cv2.dnn.blobFromImage()` before being passed to the neural network.

3. **Detection Logic**
   - The model returns bounding boxes, class IDs, and confidence scores.
   - Detections with confidence above a set threshold (e.g., 0.5) are visualized using OpenCV.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

Make sure to install the required packages:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```


If using the provided virtual environment, activate it and install the packages from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Project

Run the object detection script with:

```bash
python main.py
```


You can modify the script to use a webcam feed or replace `lena.png` with another image for testing.
